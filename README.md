# Datepicker UI

In this project, this basic datepicker UI using only HTML and CSS. It will not be a functional datepicker for now; however, expect it to update soon with JavaScript features (including - but not limitted to - functional next and back buttons that change the month and potentially even year). Anyway, this visual datepicker UI is completed as part of [a Roadmap.sh assignment](https://roadmap.sh/projects/datepicker-ui), so check out and enjoy looking at the design of the webpage [right here](https://azerjlhj.github.io/Datepicker-UI/).
